           In terms of acquisition of learning, before it is only a matter of learning, just giving the ideas to the learners in order for them to internal ized on what is going on and on what will be in the next generation but to day, it is not just a ingesting of ideas but it is more one practical matter, the of learning today is more on hands-on-minds-on process it focusses on out come based wherein in all things that they have learned must put into action.
